# Troubleshooting
## Stream Failover not working
* Check if the Stream Profile (default and/or for the channel) is set to redirect. Stream failover will not work for redirect

## Will you implement X new feature?
* Check existing feature requests in our [discord](https://discord.gg/Sp45V5BcxU) or [github](https://github.com/Dispatcharr/Dispatcharr/issues). If it's not already requested, feel free to request.
